f anyone still wants to do that you can do it like this;

go to .config > neofetch > config.conf

and find
# text colors "about line 200"
# ascii colors "about line 700"

lines

colors=(distro) it looks like this on default but you can change it like you want
for example Ä± wanted cyan and white so i wrote;

colors=(6 7)

0 = black

1 = red

2 = green

3 = yellow

4 = blue

5 = magenta

6 = cyan

7 = white

8 = default foreground color

it was like this on my terminal you can try and find how you like.

make sure you change the one with non comment line and to save it.
