Option A: Using /usr/local/bin (system-wide, no PATH changes needed)
Step 1: Make sure your game script has the correct first line (shebang)


Open your Python game script (move_char.py):
nano ~/games/move_char.py

Make sure the very first line is:
#!/usr/bin/env python3

If it’s not there, add it.

Save and exit (Ctrl + O, Enter, then Ctrl + X).

Step 2: Make your script executable
chmod +x ~/games/move_char.py

Step 3: Copy your script to /usr/local/bin and rename it to your command
sudo cp ~/games/move_char.py /usr/local/bin/playgame

You’ll be asked for your password because this needs root permission.
Step 4: (Optional) Make sure the copied file is executable (should be, but just in case)

sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/playgame

Step 5: Now you can run your game from anywhere in the terminal by typing:
playgame

Step 6: To stop the game, press q (or whatever your quit key is).
Troubleshooting:

    If playgame doesn’t work immediately, try closing and reopening the terminal.

    You can check if /usr/local/bin/playgame exists and is executable:

ls -l /usr/local/bin/playgame
